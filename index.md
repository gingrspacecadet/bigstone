# Welcome to the Bigstone Wiki!

## **What is Bigstone?**
Bigstone is a custom redstone-like system where components are supersized to a 16x16x16 block scale. Each Bigstone component simulates its function using regular redstone.

While scaling redstone components to larger sizes like this isn‚Äôt a new idea, Bigstone goes further by:
- Adding unique functionality to familiar components
- Introducing entirely new types of components (heavy repeaters, chain lamps, dust bridges, etc...)
- Following a consistent set of design rules to make components compatible with each other

At this point, it‚Äôs no longer just ‚Äúbig redstone‚Äù, which is why we call it Bigstone!

## **How Bigstone Works**
Even though Bigstone isn‚Äôt meant to behave exactly like redstone, everything is still built using redstone. That means:

1. You‚Äôre still limited to what‚Äôs possible with vanilla redstone. For example, you can‚Äôt just make a Bigstone component that instantly and wirelessly sends a 10 Hz signal across dimensions. Bigstone components have the opportunity to be very unique and interesting, but they are still grounded by the limits of redstone.

2. Almost anyone can contribute! If you have Java Edition (sorry Bedrock players üò¨) and a decent understanding of redstone, you can absolutely make your own Bigstone components! That‚Äôs one of the biggest reasons we created this server‚Äîto give people a space to build and share their ideas.

## **Compatibility Info**
To keep our Bigstone components consistent and compatible with each other, I‚Äôve followed a few core standards when building our own Bigstone components.

**Bigstone Wires:**
All signal wires of mine use instant wire, which means signals travel instantly down long lines. Each wire also contains two independent redstone lines that go in opposite directions. our inputs and outputs are always in the same places, so you can freely link together wires, chain lamps, repeaters, etc.

**Directional Components:**
Some components however, such as Bigstone repeaters, are directional. These will only have one input and one output, typically on opposite sides. Even so, the output will still be aligned properly so it can connect with wires or other components that are 2-way.

This makes it easy for you to chain components or hook them up to any other Bigstone element.

If you are attempting to make your own Bigstone components compatible with mine, we recommend that you follow the same system, and also download our world with all of our Bigstone components and do some testing between them to ensure compatibility.

By all means though, feel free to come up with your own standard if you so wish! That's the great thing about Bigstone: you have the freedom to do almost anything with your Bigstone. Just make sure to let others know what system you use.
